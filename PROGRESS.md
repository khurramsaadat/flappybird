# Progress Log

## 2025-06-03
- User requested: Idle bird should float smoothly in a sine wave, looping every 5 seconds, with no pause between loops. Animation speed and amplitude should scale with screen size. Minimum pipe gap on mobile should be bird height x 6 for both horizontal and vertical gaps. Add comments for easy tweaking.
- User confirmed all clarifications and requested to proceed.
- Implemented a smooth, looping idle bird animation (sine wave, 5s loop, amplitude scales with bird size).
- Enforced minimum pipe gap (bird height x 6) for both horizontal and vertical gaps on mobile devices for better playability.
- Added clear comments in code for easy tweaking of these values.
- Checked and resolved all Problems tab and terminal issues before and after changes.
