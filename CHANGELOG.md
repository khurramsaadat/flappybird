# CHANGELOG

## 2024-06-09
- Added `@playwright/test` to `devDependencies` in `package.json` for test support.
- Ran `npm install` to update dependencies.
- Staged, committed, and pushed changes to GitHub.
- Fixed ESLint error in `src/app/page.tsx` by correcting the `onClick` handler for the `<canvas>` element to use a direct ternary expression, resolving Netlify build failure.
- Replaced all <img> tags with Next.js <Image /> component for all images, including game assets, for better optimization and to resolve ESLint warnings.
- Removed unused GAME_GUIDE variable from page.tsx.
- Used useCallback for handleJump and updated useEffect dependencies accordingly.
- Refactored game over logic to use ref for instant state updates.
- Attempted to implement fade-in animation for game-over.png and sequential fade for scores/message (not yet working as intended).
- Removed debug overlays and alerts from draw function.
- Fallback 'Game Over!' red text and message still showing; further work needed to fully remove and unify custom UI.
- Updated PostCSS config to use `@tailwindcss/postcss` as the plugin for Tailwind v4 compatibility and Netlify build fix.
- Fixed PostCSS config: replaced '@tailwindcss/postcss' with 'tailwindcss' in postcss.config.mjs to resolve Netlify build error.
- Created `favicon.svg` (yellow circle with white 'f') and removed `favicon.ico`; ensured layout uses `favicon.svg` only.
- Fixed image aspect ratio warning for `Flappy-Bird-Logo.png` by setting both width and height and using `width: auto`.
- Made bird rotation smooth and natural using lerp interpolation, keeping max angle at 30 degrees.
- Cleaned up `public/` directory and code for production.
- Updated directory structure to reflect `favicon.svg` and removal of `favicon.ico`.
- Removed unused variables (`showScore`, `isGameOver`) and all related logic for code cleanliness and Netlify build success.
- Fixed linter errors by ensuring `ctx` is not null before use in the draw function.
- Updated useEffect dependency array for responsive canvas scaling to include both `height` and `width`.
